# InfiniteTunnel

InfiniteTunnel is a little android game I made during my freetime using Unity3D


## Installation

Install [Unity3D](https://unity.com) import the repository as a project and compile it.

Or just use the .apk in the APK folder and use it on the android phone of your choice.

Or download it from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PotatoeGame.InfinitTunnel)


## Control

Just tilt your phone to control the spaceship.


## Info

You can use all of the files as you want.
There should be some bugs.
